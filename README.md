Assignment 2 - Haunted Jaunt Game

Elias Charles, Nathan Pang, Madeline Porcaro, Patrick Rodriguez

Primarily followed the tutorial from [here](https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner)

After the tutorial was followed, there were some extra components added:

## Tutorial Section Work 

### Dot Product - Elias
Added "boo-like" ghost that follows the player when its back is turned to the ghost.
> Scripts : Follower.cs


### Linear Interpolation (LERP) - Nathan
Using LERP, the ghosts will change color depending on how long the player has been spotted for
> Scripts:  Observer.cs

### Particle Effects - Maddie
While there were particle effects already in the orginal tutorial, more were added  
as a green particle effect added to one of the paintings and under the beds for a spooky effect. 
> No Scripts Needed: All in Scene.

### Custom Gameplay Effects
All of the bonus gameplay effects (i.e. effects not contained in the tutorial) are on their separate branches at the moment, we are working on merging them.
