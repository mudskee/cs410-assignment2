Assignment 2 - Haunted Jaunt Game

Elias Charles, Nathan Pang, Madeline Porcaro, Patrick Rodriguez

Primarily followed the tutorial from [here](https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner)

After the tutorial was followed, there were some extra components added:

### Dot Product

### Linear Interpolation (LERP)
Using LERP, the ghosts will change color depending on how close they are to the player

### Particle Effects
While there were particle effects already in the orginal tutorial, more were added to the radiators for a visual effects 
and a green particle effect added to some of the paintings for a spooky effect.
